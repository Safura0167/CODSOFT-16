        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>"I’m a Undergrad engineering student who loves creating websites and apps. I believe that you have to be able to see the big picture when you’re building something, and that’s why I like to work with a team.
             It’s also why I love working in groups where everyone has a voice, but we all work together toward the same goal—to make your site better than you could ever do on your own.. I love to work in groups where everyone can voice their opinions and ideas. In the end, I love to work towards one goal where in the end we all can contribute towards making a good website. In my free time, you can see me listening to songs and binge-watching series when I am not working with my clients."</p></center>
